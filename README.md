## Jomiru Sergiu
Hello, my name is Sergiu Jomiru, and I am the Head of Aerospace Systems Engineering at LSAS Tec. Currently I am responsible for the aerospace systems research and development, architecture, planning, management, maintenance and quality control. 

We are providing some of the most advanced space systems and solutions for situational awareness and mission analysis. We focus mainly on SSA and SDA, mission planning, simulations, orbit determination and sensor calibration, maneuver processing, observation association, re-entry analysis, conjunction analysis, launch analysis, RPOs, and overall flight dynamics for the entire mission lifecycle. 

Our systems have been used in multiple missions like ARTEMIS, JWST, LADEE, IBEX, ALOS or such satellite constellations as TDRSS, GPS, INTELSAT and many more. Our solutions have been used for decades by space and defense agencies like NASA, ESA, JAXA, ISAS, JMA, JMOD and JSDF as well as various private companies related to rockets, spacecrafts, aircrafts, satellites and missions control facilities.

While working in engineering for the past 15 years, I have had the privilege of contributing to development of space technologies, and gained the proper understanding on how important teamwork & cooperation is for achieving great goals and help build a better future.<br /><br />
